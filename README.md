# LatentScoreEstimation
Estimates subject's latent liking scores using a Bradley-Terry based Bayesian logistic regression model.

## How to use
Open 'main_script.R', and run line-by-line. 

## Input data
An example datafile is included: 'example_subject_datafile.csv'. This file shows the data format that the model expects from the input data. 
It represents experimental data collected from one subject and for a single run. 
The data preparation script expects the files for each run to be located in subject-specific directories.
